## Description
My task was to write a Javascript application that generates a random password based on the user's chosen character types given starter code. The requirements were: 

* Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password should be at least 10 characters but no more than 64
    * Choose desired character types:
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
* Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected

The generated password is displayed on the page.
